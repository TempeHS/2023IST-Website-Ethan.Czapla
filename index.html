<h1> Dulce et Decorum Est (It is sweet and proper) - Wilfred Owen</h1>

<P>Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling
And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—
Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In all my dreams before my helpless sight,
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.</P>
<P></P>
<P>If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,
His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
To children ardent for some desperate glory,
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The words 'Dulce et decorum est Pro patria mori' translated from Latin reads 'It is sweet and right to die for ones country'.</P>

<h1> Wilfred Owen </h1>
<P> Wilfred Owen was a service men and poet during World War 1 or 'The Great War' as it was 
called in his time. The main subject of his speeches was anti-war, contrasting the patriotic 
and romantiscised propaganda in the earlier stages of war. His main works consist of the 
horrors of the trenches and gas warfare. He was killed in service, a week prior to the end
of World War 1. </P>
