	<button class="button button-1">Dulce et Decorum Est (It is sweet and proper) - Wilfred Owen</button>
</Div>
<P>Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, </p>
<P>Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,</p>
<P>Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,</p>
<P>And towards our distant rest began to trudge.</p>
<P>Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,</p>
<P>But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;</p>
<P>Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots</p>
<P>Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.</P>
<P> .</P>
<P>Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling</p>
<P>Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,</p>
<P>But someone still was yelling out and stumbling</p>
<P>And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—</p>
<P>Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,</p>
<P>As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.</P>
<P> .</P>
<P>In all my dreams before my helpless sight,</p>
<P>He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.</P>
<P> .</P>
<P>If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace</p>
<P>Behind the wagon that we flung him in,</p>
<P>And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,</p>
<P>His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;</p>
<P>If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood</p>
<P>Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,</p>
<P>Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud</p>
<P>Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—</p>
<P>My friend, you would not tell with such high zest</p>
<P>To children ardent for some desperate glory,</p>
<P>The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est</p>
<P>Pro patria mori.</P>
<P> .</P>
<P>The words 'Dulce et decorum est Pro patria mori' translated from Latin reads 'It is sweet and right to die for ones country'.</P>

</div>
<P> Wilfred Owen was a service man and poet during World War 1 or 'The Great War' as it was called in his time. The main subject of his speeches was anti-war, contrasting the patriotic and romantiscised propaganda </p> 
<P> in the earlier stages of war. The main works consist of the horrors of the trenches and gas warfare. He was killed in service, a week prior to the end of World War 1. </P>
